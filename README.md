# System-Analysis-Project

## introdcution
In this project we were trying to find a system in anytype like queue systems in place or customers service.., we came across one of the health service provider "AL-Abeer Hospital" they has many difficulty, so we suggested four idieas: first elderly service, second is rental of medical supplies, third hospital logistics and lastly optimizing booking system, we have choose the last idiea which is optimizing the current booking system the three were declined due to some complexity and technical issues. Moreover we have noticed that there is a lot of foreigner people who comes to the hospital and an unoptimized booking system could lead to a chaotic situation in the hospital.
## Objective
The main purpose is to optimize the current booking system.
## Methodology 
After listing the four idea we performed flowcharts that represent the shape of the system as it is shown i the powerpoint linked with files, after that a decision matrix was used to determine which one is the most suitable, after that SWOT analysis was used to see the opportunity for the current system and lastly the fishbone digram to see the problems.
